/*
(Geometry: intersecting point) Suppose two line segments intersect. The two endpoints for the first line segment are (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and for the second line
segment are (x3, y3) and (x4, y4). Write a program that prompts the user to enter
these four endpoints and displays the intersecting point. As discussed in Programming Exercise 3.25, the intersecting point can be found by solving a linear equation. Use the LinearEquation class in Programming Exercise 9.11 to solve this
equation. See Programming Exercise 3.25 for sample runs.
