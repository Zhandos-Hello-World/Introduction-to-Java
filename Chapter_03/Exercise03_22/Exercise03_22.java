/*
(Geometry: point in a circle?) Write a program that prompts the user to enter a
point (x, y) and checks whether the point is within the circle centered at (0, 0) with
radius 10. For example, (4, 5) is inside the circle and (9, 9) is outside the circle, as
shown in Figure 3.7a.

(Hint: A point is in the circle if its distance to (0, 0) is less than or equal to 10.
The formula for computing the distance is âˆš(((x2 - x1)^2) + ((y2 - y1) ^2)). 
Test your program to cover all cases.) Two sample runs are shown below:
	

	Enter a point with two coordinates: 4 5
	Point (4.0, 5.0) is in the circle

	Enter a point with two coordinates: 9 9
	Point (9.0, 9.0) is not in the circle
