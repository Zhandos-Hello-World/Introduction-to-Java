/*
(Algebra: solve 2 * 2 linear equations) A linear equation can be solved using
Cramerâ€™s rule given in Programming Exercise 1.13. Write a program that prompts
the user to enter a, b, c, d, e, and f and displays the result. If ad - bc is 0, report
that "The equation has no solution."

	Enter a, b, c, d, e, f: 9.0 4.0 3.0 -5.0 -6.0 -21.0
	x is -2.0 and y is 3.0

	Enter a, b, c, d, e, f: 1.0 2.0 2.0 4.0 4.0 5.0
	The equation has no solution
