/*
(Game: hangman) Programming Exercise 7.35 presents a console version of
the popular hangman game. Write a GUI program that lets a user play the
game. The user guesses a word by entering one letter at a time, as shown in
Figure 20.18. If the user misses seven times, a hanging man swings. Once
a  word is finished, the user can press the Enter key to continue to guess
another word.
