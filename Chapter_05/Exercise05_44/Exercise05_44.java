/*
(Computer architecture: bit-level operations) A byte value is stored in 8 bits. Write
a program that prompts the user to enter a byte integer and displays the 8 bits for
the integer. Here are sample runs:

    Enter an integer: 5
    The 8 bits are 00000101

    Enter an integer: â€“5
    The 8 bits are 11111011

(Hint: You need to use the bitwise right shift operator (>>) and the bitwise AND
operator (&), which are covered in Appendix G, Bitwise Operations.)
