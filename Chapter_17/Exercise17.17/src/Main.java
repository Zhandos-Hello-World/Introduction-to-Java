/*
(BitOutputStream) Implement a class named BitOutputStream, as shown
in Figure 17.22, for writing bits to an output stream. The writeBit
(char bit) method stores the bit in a byte variable. When you create a
BitOutputStream, the byte is empty. After invoking writeBit('1'), the
byte becomes 00000001. After invoking writeBit("0101"), the byte becomes
00010101. The first three bits are not filled yet. When a byte is full, it is sent to
the output stream. Now the byte is reset to empty. You must close the stream by
invoking the close() method. If the byte is neither empty nor full, the close()
method first fills the zeros to make a full 8 bits in the byte and then outputs the
byte and closes the stream. For a hint, see Programming Exercise 5.44. Write a
test program that sends the bits 010000100100001001101 to the file named
Exercise17_17.dat.
