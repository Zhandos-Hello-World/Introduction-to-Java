/*
(Split files) Suppose you want to back up a huge file (e.g., a 10-GB AVI file) to a
CD-R. You can achieve it by splitting the file into smaller pieces and backing up
these pieces separately. Write a utility program that splits a large file into smaller
ones using the following command:
java Exercise17_10 SourceFile numberOfPieces
The command creates the files SourceFile.1, SourceFile.2, . . . , SourceFile.n,
where n is numberOfPieces and the output files are about the same size
