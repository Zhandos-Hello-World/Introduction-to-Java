(Restore objects from a file) Suppose a file named Exercise17_07.dat has
been created using the ObjectOutputStream from the preceding programming exercises. The file contains Loan objects. The Loan class in Listing 10.2
does not implement Serializable. Rewrite the Loan class to implement
Serializable. Write a program that reads the Loan objects from the file and
displays the total loan amount. Suppose that you donâ€™t know how many Loan
objects are there in the file, use EOFException to end the loop.
